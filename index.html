      <h1 class="h1">Mini Project On HTML &CSS</h1>

      <hr />

      <br />

      <h3>Read the given instructions given below before doing your project</h3>

      <hr />

      <br />

      <ul>

        <li>
          The project for your HTML & CSS will be a
          <span class="span" style="background-color: #eff1f3" ;
            >“mini-web site.”</span
          >
          Choose a topic that interests you: something that excites you,
          something you want to tell the whole world about. If you don't care
          about the subject, your readers won't either.
        </li>

        <br />

        <li>
          I want you to concentrate on the HTML, not on finding content, so do
          not choose a topic that requires lots of research. For example, unless
          are an expert about the subject, a web site about the kings of Sweden
          will need much time-consuming research. On the other hand a website
          about your favorite hobby won't take much research at all.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <br />

      <h3>Here are further requirements for the assignment:</h3>

      <hr />

      <ol>

        <li>
          Your project must contain a minimum of ten original HTML5 pages
          (files) that you have written. A single HTML5 file with links to nine
          pages written by other people is not acceptable. You may not simply
          link to pages that you have practiced for the HTML & CSS. Your
          material must all be original.
        </li>

        <br />

        <li>
          Diagram showing links among an index page and other content pages is
          shown in the <b>Sample linkage diagram.</b>
        </li>

        <br />

        <img src="" width="500" height="400" class="image" />

        <span class="span1"><b>Example: </b></span>

        <br />

        <li>
          You must draw a diagram showing how your HTML pages link together, and
          the linkage must make sense. For the linkage diagram you can use any
          online tools to draw or you can make your diagram by hand then scan it
          or take a digital photo of the diagram and upload it to the
          <span class="span" style="background-color: #eff1f3">GitHub.</span>
        </li>

        <br />

        <b>Note:</b>
        A linkage diagram is not the same as a diagram showing. If you have many
        pages that are all linked to each other, just draw a line that connects
        them all and label it with words like “all linked to each other” rather
        than trying to draw dozens of lines with arrows on them.

        <br />
